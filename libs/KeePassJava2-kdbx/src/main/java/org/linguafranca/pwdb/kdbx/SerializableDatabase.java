/**
 * This interface allows for serialization and deserialization of KDBX databases.
 *
 * <p>Databases instantiate themselves from a stream and serialize to a stream,
 * and need to be able to encrypt and decrypt data (e.g. Protected fields in KDBX format).
 *
 * <p>KDBX databases contain a header hash (i.e. a hash of the contents of
 * some portion of the {@link StreamFormat} they have been loaded from or saved to.
 * Which means that databases must support the setting of this value after the header
 * has been written on save, and reading the value after load to allow for integrity checking.
